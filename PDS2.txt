As per the problem statement, the processor word size and instruction size are 32 bits. So, we need to have an instruction memory of at
least 2^32 bytes. However, as we do not need to use the entire memory, we can choose a smaller size.

For the data memory, we need to decide upon the amount of memory required to store data. This depends on the application that the processor 
is intended for. Since there is no information given about the specific application, we can assume a moderate size of 2^16 bytes for data
memory.

Therefore, we can decide to have an instruction memory of 64KB (2^16 words), and a data memory of 64KB (2^16 bytes).
