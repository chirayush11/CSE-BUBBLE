To design the instruction layout for CSE-BUBBLE, we can follow the traditional MIPS-style instruction format, which has the following
three types of instructions: R-type, I-type, and J-type.

R-type instructions:

The R-type instructions operate on registers only. The instruction format for R-type instructions is as follows:


6-bit op	5-bit rs	5-bit rt	5-bit rd	5-bit shamt	6-bit funct
opcode	source	source	dest	shift amount	function code


where,
op: 6-bit opcode field
rs: 5-bit source register field
rt: 5-bit source register field
rd: 5-bit destination register field
shamt: 5-bit shift amount field
funct: 6-bit function code field

I-type instructions:

The I-type instructions operate on immediate values and registers. The instruction format for I-type instructions is as follows:

6-bit op	5-bit rs	5-bit rt	16-bit immediate
opcode	source	dest	immediate


where,
op: 6-bit opcode field
rs: 5-bit source register field
rt: 5-bit destination register field
immediate: 16-bit immediate value

J-type instructions:
The J-type instructions operate on jump targets. The instruction format for J-type instructions is as follows:

6-bit op	26-bit address
opcode	target address


where,
op: 6-bit opcode field
address: 26-bit jump target address

For encoding these instructions, we can use the following methodology:

R-type instructions:
The opcode field for all R-type instructions can be set to 0b000000. The funct field will be different for each R-type instruction. 

The opcode and funct fields can be used to determine the specific operation to be performed by the ALU.

I-type instructions:
The opcode field for all I-type instructions can be assigned with unique opcodes. For example, we can use 0b001000 for addi instruction, 
0b001001 for addiu instruction, 0b001101 for ori instruction, and so on.

J-type instructions:
The opcode field for all J-type instructions can be assigned with unique opcodes. For example, we can use 0b000010 for j instruction, 0b000011
for jal instruction, and so on.

Overall, the instruction layout and encoding methodology for CSE-BUBBLE can be implemented as follows:

R-type Instructions:

The opcode for all R-type instructions will be 000000.
The funct field will specify the particular R-type instruction. The encoding for the funct field will be as follows:
add instruction: 100000
sub instruction: 100010
addu instruction: 100001
subu instruction: 100011
and instruction: 100100
or instruction: 100101
sll instruction: 000000
srl instruction: 000010
jr instruction: 001000
slt instruction: 101010


I-type Instructions:

The encoding for the opcode field will be as follows:
addi instruction: 001000
addiu instruction: 001001
andi instruction: 001100
ori instruction: 001101
lw instruction: 100011
sw instruction: 101011
beq instruction: 000100
bne instruction: 000101
slti instruction: 001010


J-type Instructions:

The opcode for all J-type instructions will be 000010.
Note: The rs, rt, rd, and shamt fields in the R-type instruction format will specify the registers that are involved in the operation,
while the immediate field in the I-type instruction format will specify the immediate value used in the instruction. 
The address field in the J-type instruction format will specify the address to jump to.
