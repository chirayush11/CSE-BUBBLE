For the CSE-BUBBLE processor, we assume a total of 32 registers, each of 32-bit size. The registers are numbered from 0 to 31. 
The following registers are used for specific purposes:

$zero (0): This register always holds the value 0.
$at (1): This register is reserved for the assembler and is not used by the programmer.
$v0-$v1 (2-3): These registers are used to hold the return values from a subroutine.
$a0-$a3 (4-7): These registers are used to pass arguments to a subroutine.
$t0-$t7 (8-15): These registers are used for temporary storage.
$s0-$s7 (16-23): These registers are used for saving values that need to be preserved across subroutine calls.
$t8-$t9 (24-25): These registers are used for temporary storage.
$k0-$k1 (26-27): These registers are reserved for use by the operating system kernel.
$gp (28): This register is used as a global pointer.
$sp (29): This register is used as a stack pointer.
$fp (30): This register is used as a frame pointer.
$ra (31): This register is used to hold the return address from a subroutine.
In addition to these registers, the PC (program counter) register is used to hold the address of the next instruction to be executed.

The usage protocol for the registers is as follows:

The registers $zero, $at, $v0-$v1, and $a0-$a3 are caller-saved, meaning that they can be modified by a subroutine and the changes will not
be preserved across a subroutine call.
The registers $t0-$t9 and $s0-$s7 are callee-saved, meaning that they must be preserved across subroutine calls. The subroutine must save
these registers on the stack if they are modified and restore them before returning.
The registers $k0-$k1 are reserved for use by the operating system kernel and should not be modified by user programs.
The registers $gp, $sp, $fp, and $ra are used for specific purposes and their usage is prescribed by the instruction set architecture.
It is important to note that the above usage protocol is a convention and can be modified based on the specific requirements of a program.
However, in order to ensure compatibility with other programs, it is generally recommended to follow the convention.
